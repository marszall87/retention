### What?

This library calculates retention metric, which answers the question: how many users<sup>1</sup> that registered<sup>2</sup> in a given week<sup>3</sup> were active<sup>4</sup> in the following weeks. In other words, how soon and how many users are abandoning you product/app or some specific feature.

<sub>1. or accounts, or instances; 2. or started trial, or enabled some feature; 3. or in any other time range; 4. or did some specific action</sub>

### Why?

Some services (e.g. keen.io) don't have built in tool or API to calculate retention metric, so you have to do it on your own. Existing tools, like keen.io's cohort builder, are usually locked into specific provider and are not very flexible - for example I needed something where I can use multiple events to determine the "active" user.

### How?

You have to provide two kinds of data sets. First, an `Array` of events that define your "registered" actions, i.e. initial events. Every event is an `Object` with `date` and `id` props:

```js
[
  {
    id: 'b7f1181a',
    date: '2018-02-19T16:57:12.188Z'
  }
  // ...more events
];
```

The second data set is an `Array` of user IDs that were active in a given time range. You have to provide this for every time range you want to calulate, i.e. if you want retentnion for the last four weeks, you should provide four `Array`s like this:

```js
[
  '855fc7a1',
  '5c8325a9',
  '2a26adea',
  '6623141d',
  '269f7d39',
  '832c4038',
  'b7f1181a'
  // ...more IDs
];
```

And that's it. The `buildMatrix` function will return a retention matrix that looks like this:

```js
[
  {
    range: {
      from: '2018-02-01T00:00:00.000Z',
      to: '2018-02-07T23:59:59.999Z'
    },
    cohort: [
      { id: 'b7f1181a', date: '2018-02-19T16:57:12.188Z' }
      // ...more IDs
    ],
    activity: [
      {
        activeCount: 757,
        percentage: 74,
        active: [
          {
            id: 'b7f1181a'
            // events: [ 'action-a', 'action-b ]
          }
          // ...more IDs
        ]
      }
      // ...more time ranges
    ]
  }
  // ...more time ranges
];
```

You can specify more than one `Array` of active users for every time range (e.g. for different actions they're performing, see below) and it will be included in every object in the `active` array in the `events` property.

Both `renderTable` and `renderChart` functions take this matrix plus some configuration options as input.

Regarding performance, it calculates and renders both table and chart in a reasonable time (<1s) on a Macbook Pro for up to ~20k unique user IDs (4 week retention). However, in such case I recommend to move the matrix calculation to some back-end service or pre-compute it offline. But let's be honest, if you have more than 20k unique users per month you wouldn't be using this simple library that I wrote over the weekend, would you? ðŸ¤”

## Installation

```sh
$ npm i retention
```

D3 and C3 libraries are not included in the bundle, you have to install them separately.

#### ES6 modules

```js
import { buildMatrix, renderTable, renderChart } from 'retention';
```

#### CommonJS

```js
const { buildMatrix } = require('retention');
```

_Notice:_ Because CJS modules are almost always used in NodeJS backend code (Webpack or Rollup should automatically use UMD or ESM version), this version includes only `buildMatrix` function, no rendering functions. If you want those you should probably explicitly include the UMD version:

```js
const { buildMatrix, renderTable, renderChart } = require('retention/dist/retention.umd.js');
```

#### Browser

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/retention@latest"></script>
<script>
    const { buildMatrix, renderTable, renderChart } = Retention;
</script>
```

#### CSS

There's also a simple CSS file which adds some styling to the table:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/retention@latest/dist/retention.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

## Sample

Clone the repo, install dependencies, build the bundle, and start a simple web server with these commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/marszall87/retention.git
cd retention
npm install
npm run build
npm run sample
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/sample` and you should see a sample retention chart and table.

## API

### buildMatrix(opts)

Returns promise with retention matrix object.

`opts.dateRanges` - `Array` of `{ from, to }` objects that defines date ranges for cohorts, if not specified it's 4 last weeks

`opts.getInitialEvents` - function that should return a promise with `Array` of objects with two props: `date` and `id`, date represents

`opts.getActivity` - function or object in form of `{ eventsA: () => {...}, eventsB: () => {...} }`, functions take three args: start date, end date and index of a given cohort date range, should return an `Array` of ids that were active in that time

### generateRanges(opts)

Helper function that generates cohor date ranges.

`opts.endingDate` - ending date of the last (most recent) cohort, end of the current day by default

`opts.daysInRange` - number of days in every date range, default is 7

`opts.rangeCount` - number of date ranges to generate, 4 by default

### renderTable(opts)

`opts.container` - container in which the table will be rendered

`opts.matrix` - retention matrix as returned by `buildMatrix()`

### renderChart(opts)

`opts.container` - container in which the chart will be rendered

`opts.matrix` - retention matrix as returned by `buildMatrix()`

`opts.options` - options passed directly to `c3.generate` function, can be used to modify the chart, full list of options available in [C3 docs](https://c3js.org/reference.html).
